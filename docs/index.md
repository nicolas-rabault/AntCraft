# AntCraft

This project is an open-source parametric 3D printable ant farm. It is designed to be easy to print and assemble, and to be easily customizable.

You can choose to easily make your own custom formicarium by changing the parameters in the Onshape document or to directly download the stl files from the THIGIVERSE page or directly from an example project on Onshape.
